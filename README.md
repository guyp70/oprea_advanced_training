Solutions for the exercises in following onenote: https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=2FF9516ED529A466%212418&id=documents.

Many of these excercises are very basic and you are free to skip them.

Some excercises do not have a solution here. Talk to me in private regarding these.

Also included per your requests is the abominable script for downloading from youtube. (LOL. Plz dont learn from it. Though easy to use, it is very much not an example of good code.)

UPDATE (Dec 23): Fastdash is old by now. You will probably be better served by libraries like streamlit and gradio if a quick web GUI is what you need.

Have fun,

GuyPo.
